## Resources
- I looked at CIS 460 lecture slides for line segment intersection
- I used the base code for CIS 460 Homework 4 for help with setting up rendering to a texture
- I looked at the following link for help setting up rendering to a texture with WebGL: https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-render-to-texture.html
- I used the following source to help sample from a WebGLTexture: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/readPixels

## Implementation
### Map
Procedure.
#### Population Map
#### Terrain Map
### Roads
General structure and intersections
#### Highway Generation
